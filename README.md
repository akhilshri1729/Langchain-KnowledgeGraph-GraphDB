# Langchain-KnowledgeGraph-GraphDB
In this project, I have converted CSV Dataset in to knowledge Graph  and connected to open course LLMs for Q&A(Queries). 
when you will open python (.ipynb) file, you will see the URL of CSV dataset. 
use your API key, you can generate API by using "Groq".
End of the code, I have written some queries for answer, But you can take any queries from your end and check you model performance.
